A Leiningen plugin to inject git commit information into project files.

## Usage

Put `[set-git-info "1.0.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile.

Provide details of files to update in `project.clj` e.g.

```clj
:set-git-info [{:path "src/myapp/buildinfo.clj" :search-regex #"::id::" :replace-field :id}
               {:path "credits.txt" :search-regex #"::author::" :replace-field :author}]
```

Then run with

    $ lein set-git-info
    
## Dry Run

To see what changes would be made without actually actioning them run as

    $ lein set-git-info :dry-run
